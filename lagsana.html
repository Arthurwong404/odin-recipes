<ul><b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</ul>
<ul><b>Canned tomatoes:</b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</ul>

<ol>2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</ol>
<ol>3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</ol>
<ol>4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</ol>
<ol>5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</ol>
